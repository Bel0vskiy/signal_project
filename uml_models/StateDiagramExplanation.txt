State diagram
  State diagram shows the procces of creating and the whole lifecycle of alerts. 
  When the system detects abnormal values and checks that is it not an error, alert created.
  Once alert is created it sends to the medical staff and need to be acknowledged by them.
  Then alert should be resolved OR automatically, if subsequent patient data shows normal readings continuously
  for a predefined period, suggesting that the condition has stabilized, OR by medical staff after assessing the patient and perhaps adjusting
  their treatment, confirming that the alert condition no longer exists.
